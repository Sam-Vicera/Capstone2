# Capstone2


Description: This project’s focus is to make a design that allows the user to find things to do and enjoy in nature. Specifically, the site helps find national parks.

Basic Requirements: 

Homepage: The page should highlight our simple organization and contain links to two other pages: a National Parks search page and a Mountains information page!

A National Parks Search Page: The National Parks search page provides a user interface that allows the user to search for the park that is just right for them. Data comes from a file named nationalParks.js provided below.


Parks Information: ~ Javascript for filtering only

Requirements for implementation and details:
Use the array provided from the zip and the nationalParkData.js file.


Two filter types; location and parktype 

Location Filter
All states are located in the locationData.js

Park type Filter: 
parkTypeData.js 
Park matches the description by checking to see if the park’s LocationName property contains the description.

Stretch Goals for Parks: 
Provide a View All National Parks Option
Some Parks provide URLs to a page about the park, display a hyperlink along with park details the user can click on.

Mountains Information Page: The mountains information page provides a user interface that allows the user to explore the details of 48 different mountains. Data will come from a file named mountains.js provided below.


Mountains Information ~ Javascript for resetting pages and displaying info

A dropdown list of the 48 mountains defined in an array in the mountainData.js file. Once a mountain is selected. Your page will display information about that mountain including:

Mountain Name
Description
Elevation
Any other information you find interesting about the mountain

Stretch Goals For Mountain:
Display the image of the mountain along with the mountain information.
Display sunset and sunrise timings by using the APIs
My own goal: A button the splits the page into two and allows mountain comparison.
